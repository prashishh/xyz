# Writing Context

This document captures the writing style, tone, and patterns used across the content sections of this site. It serves as a reference for maintaining consistency when creating new pieces for the AI section, fragments, and essays.

## General Writing Principles

The writing across all sections shares certain fundamental characteristics that create a cohesive voice. The tone balances conversational accessibility with authoritative insight, drawing from personal experience while making broader observations about technology, society, and individual experience.

First person perspective appears naturally when the content involves personal experience or direct observation. The writing avoids unnecessary qualifiers and hedging language, making direct statements that carry weight through specificity rather than through defensive phrasing. When discussing technical concepts or abstract ideas, concrete examples ground the discussion in real world application.

Sentence length varies intentionally to create rhythm and emphasis. Longer sentences build complex thoughts and connect related ideas, while shorter sentences provide clarity and punch. The writing avoids patterns that feel mechanical or formulaic, particularly the choppy sentence structures that signal automated generation.

Strategic use of formatting creates emphasis without overreliance. Italics highlight key concepts or internal thoughts, while bold text draws attention to particularly important points. These formatting choices appear sparingly and serve the content rather than decorating it.

Personal anecdotes and specific details appear throughout, transforming abstract discussions into tangible experiences. Rather than speaking in generalities, the writing references specific tools, technologies, projects, and moments that illustrate broader points. This specificity makes the content more credible and more engaging.

The writing flows naturally without excessive structure. While sections and headings organize longer pieces, the prose itself moves organically from one idea to the next. Transitions happen through logical progression of thought rather than through formulaic connectors.

## AI Section Writing Style

Articles in the AI section document technical projects and experiments with AI assisted development. These pieces combine practical technical detail with broader observations about how AI tools are changing software development.

Each article typically begins with a note acknowledging the AI assisted nature of both the project and the writing itself. This transparency sets appropriate expectations while maintaining credibility. The note appears early, usually right after the frontmatter, and uses a consistent format that references the ongoing series.

The opening paragraphs establish context through specific personal examples. Rather than starting with abstract statements about AI capabilities, these pieces begin with concrete projects: a fitness tracker, a book bot, a meditation app. These examples immediately ground the discussion in real experience.

Technical details appear throughout but always serve the narrative. When discussing implementation specifics, the writing explains not just what was built but why certain choices were made and what tradeoffs were involved. Architecture decisions connect to broader principles about development workflows and tool capabilities.

Visual elements including diagrams, screenshots, and code examples support the text without overwhelming it. These elements appear at natural points in the narrative where they clarify or illustrate the discussion. Captions provide context without repeating information already in the main text.

The writing acknowledges limitations and challenges honestly. When discussing what worked well, it also covers what struggled or required iteration. This balanced perspective makes the content more credible and more useful for readers considering similar approaches.

Economic and practical considerations receive attention alongside technical ones. Cost comparisons, time investments, and resource requirements appear naturally in the discussion, helping readers understand not just how something was built but whether the approach makes sense for their situation.

The conclusion ties together technical details, practical outcomes, and broader implications. Rather than simply summarizing what was covered, these conclusions look forward to how the patterns and learnings might apply more broadly.

Here is an example opening that demonstrates these principles:

Over the past few months, I've built three apps that only I use: a fitness tracker optimized for my home gym equipment, a Telegram bot that recommends books from my personal library, and a meditation app called Spanda. None of them will ever have a second user, and that's by design.

Generic software has served us well for decades, and that's how software has been built for the past forty years. For most of software history, building one product for millions of users was the only economically viable approach. You learned to use the small part that mattered to you and ignored the rest.

## Fragments Writing Style

Fragments are shorter, more personal pieces that capture observations, reflections, and insights. These pieces feel more immediate and less structured than longer articles, often reading like extended thoughts or journal entries that have been refined for sharing.

The opening often starts with a direct statement or observation rather than setup or context. These pieces trust that readers will follow the thought process as it unfolds, beginning in media res rather than with extensive background.

Personal experience drives the content, but the writing connects individual observations to broader patterns or universal experiences. A reflection on walking through cities becomes a meditation on connection and presence. A note about books on a shelf becomes a reflection on technological transformation.

The prose flows in a stream of consciousness style while maintaining clarity and coherence. Thoughts connect through association and logical progression rather than through explicit transitions. This creates a sense of authenticity and immediacy.

Philosophical or abstract ideas appear naturally, emerging from concrete observations rather than being introduced as topics to explore. The writing shows rather than tells, letting readers draw connections between the specific and the general.

Endings often feel open rather than conclusive. These pieces may raise questions, suggest possibilities, or simply pause at a moment of insight rather than wrapping everything into a neat conclusion.

Here is an example that demonstrates the fragment style:

I think the best way to explore a city is by walking. No doubt about it.

Whenever I travel, whether it is for a conference, a meeting, or an event, I try to carve out some time just to walk. During Token 2049 in Singapore a few years back, where the schedule was packed with side events scattered across the city, I made it a point to walk from one to the other whenever I could. The city is small, and it is lovely to move through it on foot. It was not only about getting from point A to point B, but about slowing down after a long day and pausing for a moment.

## Essays Writing Style

Essays are longer form pieces that tell personal stories while exploring broader themes. These pieces combine narrative elements with reflection, using specific experiences to examine larger questions about life, work, technology, and society.

The opening establishes a specific moment or decision that serves as the entry point for the broader discussion. Rather than beginning with abstract statements, essays start with concrete situations: a last day at a job, a decision to move, a realization about a technology shift.

Personal narrative provides the structure, with the story unfolding chronologically or thematically as the piece progresses. The writing includes enough detail to create scenes and moments that readers can visualize, while maintaining focus on the ideas and reflections that give the story meaning.

Context appears naturally within the narrative rather than as separate background sections. When discussing work experiences, the writing explains what the company did and why it mattered in the course of telling the story. Technical details serve the narrative rather than interrupting it.

Reflection happens throughout rather than being saved for the end. As events unfold, the writing pauses to consider what they mean, how they connect to broader patterns, and what questions they raise. This creates a sense of ongoing discovery rather than retrospective analysis.

The conclusion may return to the opening moment with new understanding, or it may look forward to implications and possibilities. These endings feel earned through the journey of the piece rather than imposed as required closure.

Here is an example opening that demonstrates the essay style:

Today is my last day in the United States.

I never thought I would say these words this early in my life. The US was my home far away from home for the last four and a half years. I have made a lot of close friends here, and I cherish every moment with them.

I met some of the smartest, passionate, loving and caring people in this country. The US taught me about friendship, life, work, and passion in a whole new level. There were many life changing events in the last few years, which helped me grow as an individual.

## Common Patterns to Avoid

Certain patterns signal automated or formulaic writing and should be avoided across all content types. These include phrases that serve as filler rather than substance, structures that feel templated, and rhythms that sound mechanical.

Avoid opening with phrases like "In this article" or "Let's dive in" or "In conclusion." These transitions feel artificial and add no value. Instead, begin directly with the content or idea, and let conclusions emerge naturally from the discussion.

Avoid excessive use of questions as rhetorical devices. While occasional questions can engage readers, a pattern of ending paragraphs with questions feels manipulative and formulaic. Make statements instead of constantly asking readers to consider possibilities.

Avoid lists that feel like bullet point dumps. When listing items, integrate them into flowing prose or use them sparingly for emphasis. Long lists of disconnected items break the narrative flow and feel like content generation rather than thoughtful writing.

Avoid hedging language that weakens statements unnecessarily. Phrases like "it could be argued" or "one might say" often signal uncertainty where confidence would be more appropriate. Make direct statements and let the content support them.

Avoid short choppy sentences in patterns. While variation in sentence length creates rhythm, a series of very short sentences feels mechanical and artificial. Let sentences flow naturally, using shorter ones for emphasis rather than as a default pattern.

Avoid dashes and hyphens as connectors. Use commas, periods, or restructure sentences to avoid these punctuation marks that can make writing feel fragmented or hasty.

Avoid formulaic transitions between sections. Rather than using phrases like "Now let's turn to" or "Moving forward," let the content flow naturally from one idea to the next through logical progression.

## Examples of Effective Writing

The following examples demonstrate the principles discussed above, showing how they work in practice across different content types.

From an AI section article, showing technical detail integrated with personal narrative:

My bookshelf page serves as both a personal reading archive and a recommendation resource for visitors interested in similar topics. Over the years, it has grown to include more than 1000 books across philosophy, technology, business, spirituality, and fiction. Maintaining this list has become a recurring friction point because new books arrive frequently, sometimes many in a single week, and adding them to the website is quite a manual and extensive process.

The workflow described in this article uses Telegram, Cloudflare Workers, Cloudflare KV, Gemini API with Claude Haiku and GPT-4o-mini as fallbacks, GitHub, and Netlify to reduce book cataloging to a three message conversation: photograph the books, confirm the details, and update my bookshelf on the website. The entire system runs on free tier services with zero monthly costs.

From a fragment, showing personal observation connecting to broader reflection:

You can generate a working app from a single prompt today, something that was unthinkable a decade back. AI can now write, debug, execute code and deploy it to the cloud, in a single coding session.

What used to require devs, time and money now takes a prompt. This naturally pushes the marginal cost of creating one more piece of software toward zero.

It's like what happened with photography when cameras went from analog to digital and ended up in phones. You had 24 or 36 shots on a roll of film, so you thought before you clicked. But once the marginal cost of taking one more photo became zero, people started taking thousands without thinking.

From an essay, showing narrative detail serving reflection:

As the company grew, a part of me felt that I was not making as much a difference as I did or wanted to. I started becoming comfortable with my day to day work. And a little too cozy for my liking.

But, it helped me focus on other areas that I'm passionate, especially giving back to the community.

These examples show how specificity, personal voice, and natural flow create engaging content that feels authentic rather than generated. The writing trusts readers to follow complex thoughts, makes direct statements supported by evidence, and connects individual experience to broader patterns.

## 10,000 Books

Right now my private library holds a little over a thousand books, but I like to imagine it one day reaching ten thousand. Not because I will ever read them all, but because collecting books feels like collecting seeds of knowledge.

When someone visits for the first time, I often hand them a book from the shelf. Inside the first page I note when and where I bought it, so they know this book had its own little journey before reaching them.

The shelves are surrounded by a few quiet guardians of knowledge. Saraswati with her veena, Ganesh lying down reading, Manjushree cutting through ignorance, and a warm chubby Buddha lost in a book. Their presence makes the library feel alive. One day this collection will not be mine anymore. I hope it will find its way into schools, libraries, or simply to people who will enjoy them. The spirit behind this comes from karma yoga, to act without attachment, to let go, and to feel everything and everyone as part of yourself. Books are part of that flow. They come into my life, and sooner or later, they will move on to someone else’s.

## AI and Creative Workflow

In 2015, I came across Tim Urban’s fascinating post about AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and ASI (Artificial Superintelligence). It was an interesting read, but it was not an "aha" moment for me at the time. My exposure to AI (or machine learning back then) was mostly through its use in engineering systems such as fraud detection, recommendation engines, and pattern recognition tools in our payment infrastructure. It felt more like solving backend challenges than experiencing anything magical.

That changed ten years later.

Few months ago, I fed the entire documentation of our strategy game into ChatGPT, explaining the mechanics, economy, characters, and battle logic. I expected a basic summary, but the AI understood it deeply, asked relevant questions, explored edge cases, and even suggested improvements.  It felt like I was brainstorming with an actual game designer. That was the moment it all clicked. That was the moment it all clicked. It felt crazy! It reminded me of my first time using Lyft, a ride-sharing app in Cincinnati, and showed a glimpse of how technology can fundamentally reshape the future.

Fast forward to today, the same AI can fetch data from the internet, simulate decision-making, reason, and brainstorm together. The pace of innovation is not linear. It is exponential. The momentum will only accelerate from here.

Here is how we are using AI across our creative workflow:
- Generate art and animations using Midjourney
- Produce high-quality voiceovers & sounds through ElevenLabs
- Code suggestions and debugging from Claude and Cursor
- Design and storytelling using ChatGPT and Claude
- Many more with NotebookLM, Flow!

Today, AI contributes approximately 10-15% of our codebase, and I fully expect it to exceed 50% by next year. These tools are already handling many of the tasks that used to take up our developers', editors', and artists' time. The models keep getting better, and I can see them becoming even more powerful very soon. I can already envision an AI project manager that ties everything together, managing story, code, visuals, and audio, and coordinating the production process.

This journey with AI is just beginning. I would love to hear how others in the Kathmandu community are using AI in their own projects. I would be excited to meet, share, and learn from one another. These are my stories, and I look forward to hearing yours.

## Back to Writing, Thanks to AI

The progress of AI keeps surprising me, even when I expect it to work. This blog was built in 2018 when I was experimenting with Jekyll and Hugo late at night, mostly to see if I could get something working.

Since then I tried several times to bring it back, but the system (dependencies) was outdated and would not compile. I got busy, left it aside, and never returned to it. Every now and then I thought about fixing it. Even when a colleague helped, we could not get it running.

Yesterday I finally decided to give it another try, this time with a bit more confidence that AI could handle it. Using GPT-5 inside Cursor, the blog was up and running in less than fifteen minutes. Webpack, Node, Netlify were updated and templates were all fixed.

After that I spent some time making small changes to styles, updating the template, adding new content and adjusting a bit of code. The bookshelf section was also outdated, but I had a CSV with all the books in my personal library. I uploaded it, asked GPT-5 to read it, and it wrote scripts that parsed the file and generated individual entries for every book.

Seeing my entire library appear instantly on the site was oddly satisfying. I had been holding onto that CSV for years thinking one day I would get around to it. Without AI it would have taken me a full day, maybe more.

What this shows me is that with enough context and clear instructions, AI does solve the problem. If the ask is vague, it struggles. But if you can describe the steps, the system can execute. If I had tried doing this myself, I know I would have wasted hours googling errors and maybe even given up again. Outsourcing it would have cost money and time. Instead, with Cursor and GPT-5, I could do it quickly and without frustration.

It makes me bullish about how software will be developed in the future. The way we build is going to look very different in the next five years, and it is important for developers to learn how to work with AI. These tools are about helping you execute and making your work more efficient.

## Driving Force

Every Mozillian that I have met are passionate about their work. There is no ‘I’ in the community. This sense of togetherness isn't common in today's selfish world. And to be part of this community makes me a proud Mozillian. I could have easily spent my 25-days break completing full seasons of TV series. Or, if I wanted to be productive.. work on a hobby project. Both of them sounded fun as per my liking. However, that’s not what Mozillians do. A Mozillian would spend their free time taking actions to build communities. A Mozillian would work to make the web free and open. A Mozillian would create a movement. That’s what I wanted to do too. I wanted to inspire thousands of Mozillians to push themselves in making them their dream, a reality. That’s the reason I set out on this incredible journey [to travel around the United States](https://twitter.com/mozdrive) to spread the love about Mozilla and the Open Web.

Because driving 13,000 miles in 25 days is not an easy task. The body and mind could take so much. It takes discipline and motivation throughout the journey. There were times when I questioned my decision and why I was doing there in the first place. There were times where I wanted to chicken out half-way through thinking people will forget about my commitments. However, when you are on a journey which carried such a powerful message, that itself becomes your driving force. When you truly believe in a cause, your physical body will somehow find a way to make it happen and keep you moving forward.

## Fat wallets

I paid all my orders in cash because my previous debit card was not active. But most stores didn’t accept cards anyways. This has remained the same for a long time. I hardly noticed any store with a card reader, unlike the stores in California.

Things are changing though. The government is pushing for digital & cashless payment. And e-wallets are popping up everywhere. I even gave a crash course to my dad on e-wallets.

He asked the most genuine question — किन रख्ने तेस्मा पैसा? (Why should I add money to the wallet?).

To be honest, digital payment is still in its infancy in Nepal. [Less than one percent](https://theannapurnaexpress.com/news/e-wallets-heralding-a-paperless-economy-103) of mobile users have mobile wallets, and there is so much room to grow. The core experience from the banking systems was broken. To give you an example: NIBL freezes your account if you enter your password wrong, thrice. To reset your password, you must go to their main office and pay money.

**Ridiculous!**

## Fully On-Chain

Digital ownership is what makes blockchain exciting for me. For the first time, you can actually hold something that does not vanish just because a company shuts down or pulls the plug on its servers.

In games, we never had that. I spent endless hours in FIFA, Age of Empires, DOTA, and I don’t really have anything to show for it now. When the next version came out or a server went offline, everything I built disappeared. Meanwhile, I still have a box of toys and cards from when I was younger. They are still there, still mine, carrying little pieces of memory. Digital worlds never gave us that sense of permanence, because they were never designed to. They always belonged to someone else.

NFTs were the first attempt to change this, but most of them felt incomplete. The assets were on-chain, but the real game still ran on servers controlled by someone else. You could own a token, but not the actual thing you cared about. Fully on-chain feels different. When the game, the assets, the history, even the rules are all written on the same rails, nobody can erase it or shut it down.

Right now, only a few games work this way and they look simple next to the games we play today. But that is how it always starts. The earliest text-based games looked small not because the ideas were small, but because the technology of that time only allowed words on a screen. And still, from that, came entire genres, sprawling 3D worlds, and eventually global communities. The same thing is happening now. Web3 infrastructure has grown so much in the last few years, scaling to handle far more complex systems. That is why fully on-chain games now feel possible in a way they never did before.

For me, the real importance of digital ownership is not about trading or speculation. It is about being able to keep something. To carry it with you, to pass it down if you want. Maybe one day it will not just be game items but our whole digital footprint, something we can choose to hold on to or delete ourselves, instead of leaving that power in someone else’s hands.

I cannot say when that day comes. But I know it is where we are heading, and that is enough reason to stay excited.

## Integrity

Handshake deals are the best kind of business deals. People come together, discuss their ideas and shake on it. No legal paperwork, just trust and the promise of work.

**_Integrity: the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles._**

Having the right ingredients of integrity will set the foundation for handshake deals. Being honest to yourself & others is the key to building long-term partnerships, and to creating something valuable together. Because it is impossible to start a business with someone who doesn’t pass your [trust threshold](https://organizationalphysics.com/2016/06/21/how-full-is-your-trust-battery/). 

I’m a strong believer of handshake deals, and I’ve been lucky that most of my ventures have started and ended with just verbal agreements. Legal wasn't required as we trusted our words enough. 

If you want to create a great business, you must have a have a golden and a silver circle of people. They will, in fact, vouch for you with their circle, and that is how you build a network of trust to move forward quickly.

## Joy

“What sparks joy?” — Wow, such a simple but complicated question to think about.

The first sentence that mapped on my head when I thought about this was — “What makes me happy?” Yeps, what are the things that make me happy? Period. Move along.

But it cannot be this simple, right?

I used to think that there are certain things that would always make me happy (or spark joy), many small/big things that I always look forward to doing. Those activities that I could fall back to when I need to find happiness.

Reading. Cooking. Listening to Music. Talking to friends. Writing code. Community Building. These are things that I look forward to. These are the things that I thought sparked my inner self.

But, do they always spark joy?

Not really.

They make me happy at different moments, at different circumstances. Listening to music during my commute sparks joy — when I’m reading, it’s a distraction. Cooking sparks joy when I have a lot of free time — the rest of the time I’m making to fill my tummy. Coding sparks joy when I’m making something for a cause— the rest of the time, I’m forcefully learning to get better.

For me, an activity sparks joy at a moment and for a reason.

Sometimes when I feel down, I don’t like to do anything from my make-me-happy-list. But those were suppose to spark joy in me, right?

The idea of ‘new’ can spark joy.

You might feel that a weekend trip wouldn’t spark joy after you’ve made up your mind to spend your entire weekend on your bed watching Netflix. The experience might spark joy. You don’t know. The new can spark joy.

It is interesting that this is a life long process of exploring and finding things that sparks joy inside you, or truly things that make you.

‘Til then.

## Maya

Working in tech for the past decade, I've been thinking about this concept called _Maya_ and how it maps to what I see around me. The tech industry feels like _Maya_ in action. Not sure why this keeps bugging me. _This is Maya._

You start as a junior developer, excited about every new library, every framework, convinced you're building the future. Then you become senior, and you watch the next wave of juniors get excited about... the exact same things. Different names, same energy. React becomes Vue becomes Svelte becomes whatever's next. Microservices become serverless become edge computing. _This is Maya._

Here we are, chasing the next promotion, the next salary bump, the next equity package. But I've watched colleagues get everything they thought they wanted, move to better companies, get acquired, even IPO. And then what? They're still checking Slack at 11 PM, still stressed about deadlines, still looking for the next thing. It never ends. _This is Maya._

Tech hubs are particularly good at this illusion. Everyone's chasing the unicorn exit, the life-changing money. But I know people who made it, who have serious money, and they're... still working 70-hour weeks at their next startup. Still desiring more. We've built golden handcuffs and convinced ourselves they're freedom. We think we have free will, but try leaving without another offer lined up, try taking a real break, try saying no to the urgent project. _This is Maya._

What gets me is how we've basically made suffering scalable. Junior developer problems: imposter syndrome, learning curve stress. Senior problems: architectural decisions, team management, oncall rotations. Principal problems: strategy, politics, existential questions about what we're even building. VP problems: board pressures, quarterly targets, managing managers. Founder problems... honestly, I don't even know where to start with that level of stress. Investor relations, existential company survival, the weight of everyone's livelihood. It's like we've engineered a perfect misery ladder. More money, more problems at every level. Anyway. _This is Maya._

Even our solutions just feed the cycle. Burned out at your corporate job, everyone says switch to a startup for the energy and equity. Startup grinding you down, go independent, be your own boss. Still miserable, maybe try a bigger company for the stability and benefits. It's musical chairs but with careers. We keep switching companies, switching roles, thinking the next move will fix whatever's wrong. _This is Maya._

But the problem isn't the job, the company, or even the industry. It's the belief that any configuration of external circumstances can give us what we're actually looking for. We've convinced ourselves that if we just find the right role, the right team, the right compensation package, then we'll finally feel... I don't know, satisfied? The external stuff never works out the way we think. Because what we're actually looking for isn't in the org chart or the pay grade or whatever. It's something that no amount of reshuffling can touch. _This is Maya._

The companies change names, the technologies evolve, but the stage stays the same. New actors playing the same roles. Eventually our careers end, we retire or get laid off, and whether we shipped that killer feature or got that promotion, it all becomes someone else's legacy. That recognition, that seeing through the pattern? That's where the real work begins. _And this is Maya._

---
_The concept of Maya is too immense and deep to be captured in a short fragmented thought. There have been entire books and literatures devoted to understanding it. I've just tried to map it to what I see in the tech industry._

## Notes From My AI Shelf

Over the last few months I have found myself surrounded by books, talks and podcasts on AI. I pick one up in the evenings, sometimes just to flip through a chapter, other times to get lost in the stories of how this technology came to be and might turn out to be.

_Age of AI_ and _Genesis_ explore the wider consequences of how this technology could shape our lives and societies. Books like _AI Valley_, _AI Rising_, and _Chip War_ bring a more geographical perspective, tracing how AI rose in different parts of the world and inside the companies that pushed it forward. Reading them feels almost like going through autobiographies of industries, and I enjoy that part a lot.

Then there are the ones that go under the hood. _AI Engineering_ and _3Blue1Brown’s course on Deep Learning and Neural Networks_ make the mechanics less mysterious and more approachable. Balancing the broader context with the technical detail has been exciting.

On my desk right now:
- Age of AI
- Genesis
- AI Valley
- AI Rising
- Chip War
- Co-intelligence
- The Coming Wave
- AI Superpowers
- AI Engineering
- A Brief History of Intelligence
- Nexus
- Deep Learning and Neural Networks course by 3Blue1Brown (Youtube)

What strikes me most is the parallel to the industrial revolution. Back then machines gave us muscle, multiplying human power by hundreds or thousands, and people must have thought it was sorcery. Today AI is adding intelligence. The next revolution may not be of steel or coal but of thought. And behind the scenes there is already a quiet war underway of nations, companies, and ideas to see who will shape this new age.

## On Inspiration

People have asked me a countless number of times why I moved back. I have been pondering over this for some time. For the last few weeks, I have been looking for my “inspiration”.

We find inspiration in unknown places. Places which, by nature, engulf your existence and take you to a land of discovery. The discovery isn’t through the act of finding the meaning though, but by traveling through the journey. The journey might not have checkpoints nor cheerleaders, but characters who went through their paths to connect the dots going backward. Last few weeks, these characters have been my imaginary friends from **books on history and biography.**

As life takes you through your journey, you might get caught into its net. It is essential to pause and take a hard look at your goals, and where you want to be. I did that when I was in the US. My vision didn’t match my actions. I needed a hard reset, a break to reflect and rediscover myself.

Our time is shorter, shorter than the time it takes to finish a coffee. When your focus is to simply wake up and go to work, then you get distracted and lose your trail. It is important to recognize that. It is important to make life more meaningful, purposeful & creative.

Another question that I constantly ask myself is: _Does this make me happy?_ _Does it fulfill me?_ If the answer isn’t **Hell Yes**, it is time to take concrete actions to get back to _my happiness trail_.

## Same ‘ol Kathmandu

To be honest, Kathmandu hasn’t changed a lot. I see the same shops, the same restaurants, the same school buses, the same गल्लि (small roads) at the same spots where I left them five years ago. Things have remained the same for the better, or for the worse.

I was fortunate to meet a lot of people last week that I would have met in six months in California. My phone was ringing instead of buzzing, which says that people still prefer calling instead of texting in Nepal.

The sense of community, the bond of togetherness & richness of us is powerful here. You’ll find pockets of people watching projects happening in their locality. You’ll find them talking endlessly about people, politics, and the country. One person said to me that they have 45 households in their community, and everyone knows each other. I cannot say that coming from the west.

## The Going Abroad Scenario

This is the thought process of a young student looking to go abroad without really thinking it through, simply because everyone else is doing the same. Here's a grade 12g student from Nepal who wants to leave just because everyone else is.

__Step 1: Contemplation (Thinking):__<br>
_"Look how clean those streets are."_<br>
_"Everyone abroad looks so successful."_<br>
_"No load shedding, no bandhs." (power cuts, strikes)_<br>

__Step 2: Attachment (Wanting):__<br>
_"That could be me."_<br>
_"I want that life."_<br>
_"I'm wasting my potential here."_<br>

__Step 3: Desire (Craving):__<br>
_"I NEED to get out of Nepal."_<br>
_"All my friends are planning to go abroad."_<br>
_"I can't be left behind."_<br>

__Step 4: Anger (Frustration):__<br>
_"Why was I born in this stupid country?"_<br>
_"The government is so corrupt, there's no future here."_<br>
_"People who stay in Nepal are just settling for less."_<br>

__Step 5: Delusion (Excuses):__<br>
_"I'll figure out what I want to do once I get there."_<br>
_"Even if I'm washing dishes, I'll be earning in dollars."_<br>
_"I'll get respect in society once I'm settled abroad."_<br>

__Step 6: Lost Judgment:__<br>
_"Computer Science in Canada, Business in Australia, whatever gets me out faster."_<br>
_"Who cares about my interests, I just need to go abroad."_<br>
_"Everyone else is doing it, so it must be right."_<br>

## Krishna's Alternative Path:

__Step 1: Conscious Contemplation (Clear Seeing):__<br>
_"What are the real challenges people face there?"_<br>
_"What are my actual strengths and interests?"_<br>
_"What opportunities exist in Nepal that I haven't explored?"_<br>

__Step 2: Self-Inquiry (Questioning):__<br>
_"Am I drawn to going abroad because of genuine career goals, or just social pressure?"_<br>
_"Do I even know what I want to do with my life?"_<br>
_"Why am I in such a hurry to decide?"_<br>

__Step 3: Investigation (Research):__<br>
_"Let me talk to people who've actually studied abroad about both the good and difficult parts."_<br>
_"Let me research the job market in my field of interest, both in Nepal and abroad."_<br>
_"What happens if I don't succeed abroad? Do I have a backup plan?"_<br>

__Step 4: Svadharma (Your True Path):__<br>
_"What am I naturally talented at?"_<br>
_"What would I choose if there was no social media to influence me?"_<br>
_"What if my purpose is to contribute to Nepal's development?"_<br>

__Step 5: Detached Choice (Wise Decision):__<br>
_"I will choose my path based on what's right for me, not what will get approval from others."_<br>
_"Success is doing meaningful work that aligns with my nature, whether that's in Nepal or abroad."_<br>
_"My happiness doesn't depend on external validation."_<br>

__Step 6: Inner Wisdom (Gut Check):__<br>
_"If I remove all external pressure, what do I actually want?"_<br>
_"What would make me proud of myself in 10 years?"_<br>
_"What would I choose if I couldn't tell anyone about my decision?"_<br>

_Krishna_ shows us that when we focus too much on attractive things or trends, we start a mental process that makes us lose our ability to think clearly. The trick is to stop this process right at the start, not try to fight it at the end.

## The Joy of Walking

I think the best way to explore a city is by walking. No doubt about it.

Whenever I travel, whether it is for a conference, a meeting, or an event, I try to carve out some time just to walk. During Token 2049 in Singapore a few years back, where the schedule was packed with side events scattered across the city, I made it a point to walk from one to the other whenever I could. The city is small, and it is lovely to move through it on foot. It was not only about getting from point A to point B, but about slowing down after a long day and pausing for a moment.

I have done the same in other places too. I remember walking endlessly in Turkey, wandering through streets without any plan. In Dubai it is harder, but around Marina Bay I still try. These walks are never just about reaching somewhere.

Recently, I picked up a book called In Praise of Walking. I just wanted to learn, to see if someone had written about the benefits of walking. And of course, there are plenty. Walking feels so natural because it is. Nature gave us two legs, our default mode of transportation, and it is almost funny how often we forget that.

When I visited the Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore, they encouraged us to walk barefoot, to touch the earth, to be grounded. That simple act spoke to me. It reminded me that walking is more than physical exercise. It is connection. To nature, to the city, to ourselves.

Walking has so many gifts, but above all, it sparks joy. And if you work in tech or spend most of your day on screens, I encourage you to skip that taxi or scooter at least once and walk to a destination if it is less than an hour away. It is a simple way to let your senses reconnect with the world around you.

<div class="image-wrapper" style="margin: 12px auto;"><img src="/img/singapore-walking.jpg"></div>

## The Pain of Not Doing

I like to work with people who are _intensely passionate_ about what they do. It does not matter what the field is. It could be nurturing kids, reading, writing poems, solving scientific problems, or coding a simple database service. What matters is the feeling inside, whether it is fire or love that comes from the heart. It is hard to reason and explain, but it can be understood from the depth of the inner being. It is the kind of passion that makes you forget food, water, and time.

Some people call them nerds, geeks, psycho or even cracked, but I see that as a badge of honor. To be so consumed that everything else fades away is a special feeling. And these passions do not have to be about changing the world in the Silicon Valley way of thinking. They simply bring joy and happiness to the person, something they would probably do even without money. Again, it is hard to put into words in a capitalistic world where everything seems to revolve around survival and livelihood.

I once met a man in his 60s who has spent four decades crafting wooden statues. His old home in the old square has become a living museum of sculptures and artwork. He studies scriptures, commissions manuscripts, and gathers artists to bring statues to life over months or even years. He is not wealthy, but he has given much of himself to this craft. Watching him, you realize passion can turn a lifetime into a single long project, and it makes you feel that everyone should strive for such deep longing in their own way.

Another was a painter who creates only a few traditional works a year. He spends weeks in his room working on his art. He says that he does not only do it for the money, because he sometimes gives a piece away for free. For him the act of painting itself is a blessing, and he feels grateful for what he has been doing all his life. There is something humbling about that.

I see the same spark in a colleague who makes digital games with interesting ideas. He follows an idea late into the night, not because he has to, but because he cannot let it go. I also have a friend who climbs rocks wherever he travels, always searching for a wall of stone. These may seem different, but in their eyes you see the same passion. It makes me think that passion leaves a mark in any field.

What ties all of these people together is not the craft itself, but the passion behind it. To reach that level, you need to pour yourself into the work until not doing it hurts. That is the _true pain of not doing_, and it is where the true self shines.

## Vajrapani The Senior Engineer

I came across a story in Buddhist literature that has been on my mind ever since. _Vajrapani_, known for raw power, went to _Buddha_ (the enlightened being) and asked for wisdom. _Vajrapani_ already had the strength to get things done by sheer force and power, but he wanted to know what makes effort truly meaningful.

It reminded me of engineers I know who can go deep into the codebase, fix tricky bugs, and ship features, but often only see their piece of the puzzle. What they miss is how it connects with everything else , marketing trying to explain the product, customer service handling frustrated users, finance keeping the lights on, or founders shifting direction after talking to customers and the changing dynamics of the market.

I remember one sprint retro where the team had spent two weeks refactoring part of the system. The code was clean, tests were written correctly, and everyone was proud. But while that was happening, users were still stuck on a broken checkout flow. Customer service was flooded with complaints that kept piling up, and sales had no answer when people asked what was going on. The team had done good engineering work, but in the bigger picture the company had missed the mark of actually helping customers, not just doing engineering. I have seen this happen many times in my own projects.

That was _Vajrapani’s_ realization too. _Buddha’s_ response, later called the _Prajnaparamita teachings_, was simple: __nothing stands on its own. Everything depends on something else.__ You can think of it like a distributed system. Your app does not just run on the code you write, it depends on servers, networks, users, electricity, and the frameworks built by people you will never meet. Change one piece and the whole thing shifts.

For _Vajrapani_ this was not just theory or philosophy, and because he was the embodiment of raw power and action he needed more than words alone. It gave him a different way to act, not by simply adding more force but by stepping back to see how his actions affected the larger system and where his effort would truly make a difference. Instead of pushing harder in one direction, he learned to see how the parts fit together. His strength was still there, but now it worked with the whole picture rather than against it.

And maybe that is what we miss sometimes. We have endless tools, frameworks, and the ability to build almost anything, but without wisdom it feels like we are running after nothing. More code, more features, more load, but not always more clarity.

Force can move mountains, but wisdom decides which mountain is worth moving.

## Writing more or less

My virtual mentors for writing are [Tim Urban](https://waitbutwhy.com/) and [Derek Sivers](http://sivers.org/). These two incredible human beings have a completely different writing styles. Tim writes long articles narrating as the first person and every nooks and corner of the subject. Derek writes short, crisp and valuable life lessons. My favorites are [this](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html), [this](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html), [this](https://sivers.org/hellyeah) and [this](https://sivers.org/evers).

Inspired by them, I tried writing a couple of drafts for #abakgarne. But it turned out horrible and, most importantly, didn’t capture my intention nor thought. It felt forced, and I had to scratch my head to write them.

As I go through my journey, I want to make the process fun for me and for everyone. I constantly ask myself what this publication should represent. The short answer is that I still don’t know. But, I’m sure that we are going to find out.

I want to make the journey fun and enlightening. And if there is a way you want to be part of this, [please say hi](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@prashishh%20Hello%20...)! I’m always looking to meet people to listen to their crazy ideas.

## 18 is the New 25

AI can teach you technical skills like programming, data analysis, digital marketing, and design tools faster than university can, especially for things that change every few months. What it can't teach you is how to work with a team, handle real deadlines, or deal with customers, and that only comes from being in the field i.e. experience.

The old model was spend four years at university till you're 25, then start working. But for most fields, especially in tech, you can start at 18 with an apprenticeship, an internship, or an entry level job. The new model is to learn by doing and pick up what you need from AI along the way. Do your degree on the side if you need it, or finish it in two years instead of four.

Two years working puts you ahead of two years sitting in lecture halls. These days employers care more about what you've built and what you can do than what degree you have. It is important to start earlier, get more time on the field, learn faster and iterate.

## 40/40/20 for Developers

Most developers spend 100% of their time just coding and wonder why they're not growing. The game changed when AI got good enough to write code with you. If you're not adjusting your time allocation, you're already behind.

**40% - actual deep work:** writing code, designing architectures learning new paradigms, reviewing other people's code, the stuff that still needs real human developer as of 2025.

**40% - using AI tools:** to optimize everything, learning Cursor, Claude Code and new coding assistant tools coming out, MCP and all the experimental AI, bringing collective coding intelligence into your workflow, making yourself faster.

**20% - the human element:** sharing your work through blogs or tweets, contributing to open-source, showing up at meetups and conferences, talking to people and surprisingly the best devs will also scale this up in the next decade.

If you're spending 100% on just coding, you're optimizing for a world that ended two years ago.

## AI Politics Problem

I've been seeing these polished documents floating around social media with detailed solutions and examples for [Nepal's political crisis](https://nepalitimes.com/news/kathmandu-burns-despite-pm-resignation), mostly written by ChatGPT or other AI systems. __This is quite insane and borderline dangerous. I can't stress this enough!__

Nepal just went through massive upheaval, where people died in the streets because of decades of political dysfunction. And some people think feeding prompts to generate the perfect solution to the problem is going to solve the issue.

ChatGPT and other AI systems are nothing but __sophisticated autocompletes__, and they don't understand Nepal's internal politics, ethnic tensions, economic dependence on remittances and its big neighbors, or why the same political class has been playing musical chairs for decades. My biggest fear is that young leaders might actually take its suggestions seriously. The last thing you need is fake wisdom generated by a machine that has zero understanding of what's on the ground.

A nation is not a coding problem, and you can't debug centuries of political mess with prompts and algorithms. Talk to experts, and stop outsourcing your political thinking to machines. Real solutions require humans who actually live with the consequences. This moment is immensely important for Nepal and all Nepali.

## Default Mode

Show a bone to a dog and watch what happens. Something deep in its _operating system_ just fires up and it moves toward the bone, same with ants and sugar or moths and light. They have a __default mode__ for this, programmed so deep they cannot help but follow them.

Humans aren't that different, we just have more layers of defaults and most of us don't even know they're running in the background. Some parts are physical like fear, hunger, pleasure, and others are psychological formed by memory and experience. 

Beneath all that are deeper patterns that ancient teachers called _samskara_, tendencies stored inside us from past actions and thoughts.

You get cut off in traffic and anger rises before you've decided to be angry, someone criticizes your work and defensiveness kicks in automatically, you reach for your phone when bored and open the same apps in the same order "without thinking". These aren't really conscious choices but defaults executing themselves unconsciously.

In yogic psychology, there's this concept called the __samskara-vritti cycle__ where _samskaras_ are deep tendencies and _vrittis_ are the thoughts that bubble up from them. The cycle works like buried tendencies rising from unknown depths, surfacing as thoughts, getting expressed through speech or action, then sinking back down to reinforce the original tendency even stronger. It keeps rotating continuously and building the same tendencies deeper with each cycle.

But there's this tiny window that exists between the tendency starting to rise and the thought fully forming at the surface of your mind. In that moment, before you've invested psychic energy into it, there's a split second where you can actually choose whether to allow this thought or redirect it somewhere else.

Advanced yogis spend years developing the ability to catch these bubbles rising from deep inside before they reach the surface and become fully formed thoughts. This takes lots of dedicated practice in meditation. For most people, this window is invisible because the bubbles rise too fast.

If you catch them enough times at the seed stage, the _samskara_ itself starts to change. The tendency that used to bubble up automatically becomes weaker while new patterns you've been choosing start to strengthen. This is what true transformation looks like as your defaults slowly get rewritten not by forcing different behavior at the surface but by catching things at that barely noticeable point where they first emerge.

<div class="image-wrapper" style="margin: 12px auto;"><img src="/img/unknown-depth.jpg"></div>

*The samskara-vritti cycle comes from Patanjali's Yoga Sutras. Samskaras are often understood as tendencies carried across lifetimes, though the mechanism works whether you accept that framework or simply view them as deeply conditioned patterns formed in this life.*

## Dial-Up AI

I spend hours every day talking to AI through text prompts and screenshots while building concepts, and it definitely feels like using dial-up internet from the past. The AI is smart, but our communication methods are very slow. I type explanations, upload images, and describe what I want. And the AI responds.. I correct it, upload more screenshots to show what went wrong and we go back and forth with each back and forth taking forever. But there's a bigger bottleneck: even when the AI gives me the perfect code, I still need to see the results with my eyes, run the application, check if it works (at least human-ly), take screenshots to show problems, then explain again.

Eventually we'll have direct brain-computer interfaces i.e. transferring complete context directly to the AI without typing or screenshots, just thoughts flowing from the mind to machine. AI will probably interface directly with your visual system too, letting AI systems see the application directly. Similar to dial-ups in the past, AI development feels very slow right now. The intelligence is getting better and faster every day, but we are limited by keyboards and screens and our slow human hands.

## The Full Stack Founder

A full stack founder is someone who has enough skills across many parts of a company, from product and engineering to team and capital. It is not about mastery in every area, but about knowing enough to follow what is going on and to join the work when needed. 

Just like a full stack engineer works across the entire technical stack, a full stack founder works across the entire company stack.

It starts with **I am an engineer**, then **I can build a product**, then **I can bring people together and lead a team**, then **I can bring in revenue**, then **I can raise money**, and finally **I can carry the whole idea forward**.

 The skills span *engineering and design, team building and culture, storytelling and strategy, revenue and finance, funding and investor relations.*

This progression used to happen slowly as companies grew and hired. Now, with AI tools and small teams, founders move through these skills faster and hold multiple roles longer. Range is no longer optional.

A full stack founder knows enough in each area to sit with any part of the team, understand their work, ask good questions and make clear decisions for now, and then hand it over when someone better arrives.

*Yusuf Goolamabbas ([@yusufg](https://x.com/yusufg)) mentioned the term (Full Stack Founder) in one of our conversations and the word just stuck with me.*

## Here and There in a Game

When you play an open world game like GTA or Skyrim, you experience walking through a whole city or landscape where different locations seem real and separate. The shop is here on this street, the mission location is way over there across town, your safe house is somewhere else. As you play, these places feel genuinely distant from each other, and it takes time to travel between them.

__But here's what's actually happening.__ All those places that feel so distant while playing exist at the same moment in your computer as data in memory. There's no actual distance between them in the code. They're just different data structures in memory.

When your character walks from one place to another, nothing is really moving. The game engine is loading and unloading different pieces of data, and rendering them on screen frame by frame, to create the _illusion of movement through space._

Even time doesn't really flow in the game; it runs frame by frame. You can pause it completely, speed it up or slow it down with mods or cheat codes. Time is just something the rendering engine creates to make things feel coherent.

The world you experience as a player, all the space and distances and time passing and cause and effect, emerges from source code that gets processed through your GPU, which renders it into images your screen displays. But in the actual code, there is no here and there and there is no time.

If the game character was actually conscious and aware like we are, they would have no way to know any of this. From their perspective, the city would feel completely real and external. They would walk from place to place, time would pass, they would get hurt if someone shoots them. Everything would seem absolutely real with no way to access the underlying code generating their reality.

This is exactly what happens when you dream too.

When you dream, you're in a house, then in a forest, then talking to someone in a marketplace. These locations feel separate and real, you feel yourself moving between them, conversations happen that seem to take time. But when you wake up, you realize the whole thing was generated by your sleeping mind. There was no actual forest separate from the house, both existed as mental activity. 

Your dreaming mind created the entire framework of space and time from itself, without any actual space or time being there, the same way game code creates space and time experience without existing in space or time itself.

If the game character was conscious, everything would feel absolutely real with no way to access the code generating it. Physical reality feels the same to us. The sense of here and there, of time flowing, arises without existing at any location in the framework it creates.

---

_People figured this out thousands of years ago without computers or games to help explain it. A teacher once asked students "you say you are here and I am there, but are not both here and there appearing within you?"_

## Infinite Software

You can generate a working app from a single prompt today, something that was **unthinkable** a decade back. AI can now write, debug, execute code and deploy it to the cloud, in a single coding session. 

What used to require devs, time and money now takes a prompt. This naturally pushes the marginal cost of creating one more piece of software toward **zero**.

It's like what happened with photography when cameras went from analog to digital and ended up in phones. You had 24 or 36 shots on a roll of film, so you thought before you clicked. But once the marginal cost of taking one more photo became zero, people started taking thousands without thinking.

Similarly, opening a physical store costs real money for inventory, rent and other physical expenses, whereas opening a digital shop on Instagram doesn't really cost anything. The same is happening with software.

Software code, at its core, is compute. More AI models launch every few months, competition pushes prices down, data centers scale up around the world and chips get better. As compute gets cheaper, generating code gets cheaper. The marginal cost of creating software approaches zero.

We'll have infinite software, but not infinite good software.

<div class="image-wrapper" style="margin: 12px auto;"><img src="/img/infinite-sw.jpg"></div>

## LLMs as Operating Systems

The next wave of software treats LLMs as first-class citizens, not as just AI features added onto existing products.

You build apps on top of operating systems like Windows or Android, you don't build Windows into your app. LLMs have become the platform now.

Cursor rebuilt their entire IDE with the chat window permanently visible on the right side, handling everything from planning, writing, debugging to deploying code. Perplexity started fresh and reimagined search as a conversation instead of a list of links. Warp threw out decades of terminal design and built it new with AI baked into every interaction.

These are not AI features added on top of existing tools, but entire products reimagined with AI as the foundation.

When **intelligence is the foundation**, you rethink how people interact with your software, what the interface looks like, which workflows make sense, what becomes possible that wasn't before.

We're still early in figuring this out, but you can already see the difference between apps that added AI and apps that were built on it. The next few years will have more breakout products built entirely on the LLM OS.

## Love and Greed in Crypto

*Note: While this framework applies to any community, from startups to religious movements to open source projects, I'm using crypto community as a reference point here because I have been working actively in this industry for the past 5 years and been here since 2014.*

Crypto promised to change everything with decentralized communities, shared ownership, power to the people, but if you spend time in most crypto communities, you will notice something else. People are always asking _"wen moon?_", _"wen airdrop?"_ and mostly talking about the token price. The moment the price drops, half the community disappears overnight. This is clearly not real community, but a collective group driven by price action.

But I find there is something deeper happening here. The way people relate to crypto projects follows the same pattern as we do for human relationships. There are three stages of love, and most crypto communities never move beyond the first one.

I know it sounds weird to talk about love in an industry built on speculation and pump-and-dump schemes, but after watching the same patterns repeat for over a decade, this framework helps me understand why some projects build lasting communities while others collapse the moment the hype dies.

### Receiving Love

Children love their parents because parents provide food, shelter, and safety. In crypto, this is when projects airdrop tokens to early users, give away NFTs, or promise future rewards. The community loves the project because they receive something of value.

This is quite natural and not wrong, and every community generally starts from here. When Ethereum gave away free tokens to early adopters, when Uniswap airdropped UNI tokens, when OpenSea shared profits with NFT creators, people genuinely felt grateful and joined these communities because they benefited from it directly.

I'm not saying receiving airdrops is evil but there is a problem with this stage. __The perceived love depends entirely on what you receive__, and the moment the benefits stop, the love completely disappears and you move on. Look at any project that stopped giving rewards.. the community goes silent overnight.

### Transactional Love

At some point, __the relationship matures__ where both the project and the community contribute to each other: the project provides support & value and the community provides feedback, adoption, promotion, sometimes even development work.

Many successful crypto projects operate at this level. Ethereum developers create new features, while the community builds applications and provides security through staking. DeFi protocols share governance tokens with users who provide liquidity. NFT projects create art while collectors provide market demand. This is what keeps most functioning communities together where both sides benefit, and both sides contribute. It works, but only as long as both sides keep getting something out of it.

But even this has limits especially when market conditions change, or when better opportunities appear elsewhere, people move on. The relationship is still based on what each side can extract from the other. I've watched entire communities migrate from one protocol to another chasing better yields, leaving behind projects they claimed to believe in.

### Unconditional Love

This is quite rare in crypto and only a handful of projects can claim this. This is when you become so aligned with a project's vision that you contribute regardless of personal benefit. You believe in the mission itself, and genuinely want to see it succeed even if you gain nothing.

This happens most clearly with Bitcoin. Some people dedicate their lives to Bitcoin, not because they expect to get rich, but because they believe in creating a monetary system that can't be controlled by governments or central banks. They see it as protection from hyperinflation, and financial censorship, especially in countries where governments regularly seize assets or devalue currency. They run nodes, educate others, build infrastructure, or defend the network against attacks. __They do this because they have become part of Bitcoin itself.__

The same thing happens with some open source projects as well. Developers contributing to core protocols without payment, educators creating content to spread knowledge, community members helping newcomers without expecting tips or recognition.

When you reach this stage, you stop asking "what can this project do for me?" and start asking "what can I do for this project?". The project's success becomes your success, not because you own tokens, but because you have become part of the vision.

### Why Most Crypto Communities Fail

Most projects never move their communities beyond stage one or two, focusing on token airdrops and rewards systems that create mercenary communities which disappear when incentives dry up.

I've seen this play out dozens of times since 2014. From ICOs to NFTs to infra projects to RWAs to memetokens to AI coins, it's the same cycle repeating over and over. Bull posting like crazy, communities full of hype-men, but the dance never lasts long enough.

Real community takes time to develop and needs genuine vision, consistent giving, and patience to let relationships grow naturally. Most crypto projects want instant community, but you cannot buy real belonging with airdrops or create it with marketing campaigns.

This is rare, but when it happens, these communities become unstoppable because they continue building as they have become the vision itself. They survive bear markets, technical setbacks, controversies, and all the chaos that comes with crypto.

I know it's weird to talk about greed in a system that's literally built on financial incentives. Crypto rewards mercenary behavior by design, but I still keep hoping to find something more genuine underneath all the speculation.

Maybe it's naive to expect love in a system built on money and speculation. __But some projects do transcend pure financial relationships, even if it's very difficult__, and sometimes I wonder if I'm being too idealistic here, but I have seen it happen. Not often, but it does happen.

## Paper to App

In 2024, I used AI to generate a workout schedule that fit my personal goals and the equipment I had, and got **a PDF** I could print to follow my workouts. 

In 2026, we'll be able to build a personalized workout **app** in a few hours and install it on our phones.

The fact that AI could understand my needs and give me a personalized schedule on a paper was mind-blowing in 2024, but now AI being able to create an entire app in an afternoon sounds crazy. 

Wonder what's in store next year.

## Purpose of Life in a Metaverse

Life is an open metaverse game. You do not enter with a guidebook or a clear goal.. you simply arrive, choose an avatar, and begin moving through a world that was already running before you joined. At first, you stumble without knowing where to go or what to do, and then slowly you begin to pick up the patterns of play.. gathering, losing, struggling, growing, and meeting countless other players who are also busy finding their own way. Some days it feels exciting, other days it feels sluggish. Many times you forget you ever asked what the point of all this was.

What stands out to me is that this world never really gives _you_ a reason for being here. There is no clear nor official announcement. What it gives instead are the conditions: __space__ to move, __time__ that passes, and __cause and effect__ to bind them together. If you touch fire you burn, if you put in the effort you grow stronger, if you lose something close you feel pain. All of this is clear inside the play and you do not question it much while you are in the middle of it.

But the moment you pause and ask why the whole _thing_ exists, the questions start to feel out of reach. To ask what was before time is already to use the word _before_, which itself belongs to time. To ask what is outside space is to use the word _outside_, which only makes sense within _space_. And to ask for the cause of everything is to ask for the _cause of causation_ itself, which is a loop that the game engine cannot resolve. __The question has no answer.__ Well, technically, the question itself is categorically wrong.

Still, we do not stop asking. Some players spend their entire life chasing this question. Others get too occupied into the tasks and quests that they forget it completely. And a few, through struggle or reflection or sheer chance, begin to sense that they were never only the avatar that runs through the world. They were always also the one sitting outside, the one who is outside the metaverse.

When you see that, the whole question becomes very light. You can still play with excitement.. you can build, you can collect, you can help others, but you do it with a lighter load because you no longer need the final answer.

I feel this even when I am working on my own projects, either designing games or building products.. getting caught up in small wins and losses that seem so important in the moment. Then something reminds me that it is all still a game. That feels like [freedom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BGSEtZNAlk), and it makes me want to keep playing, while knowing I can always step back and see it as it is.

<div class="image-wrapper" style="margin: 12px auto;"><img src="/img/multiple-screens.jpg"></div>

## The Limits of Reality

I have been thinking about how limited our understanding of reality actually is. We like to believe that what we perceive through our senses and mind is the full picture, but it is really just a thin slice of what is out there.

Let's take examples of color and sound. What we call visible light is just a tiny strip, while the rest of it, like infrared and ultraviolet, moves through us all the time without us even knowing. Sound works the same way, our ears only catch a narrow range while dogs hear higher and elephants hear lower, and whole conversations are happening that we will never hear. It is like walking through a huge dark cave with a small flashlight and assuming whatever the beam touches is the whole place.

AI has its own version of this blindness. Most systems today are language models that work with text, predicting words and patterns, but they are not touching the world itself. Even the new wave of multimodal systems that can process images, sound, or tactile input from robotic hands are still only handling data. They do not see, hear, or feel in the way we do. It is like reading about the ocean, or looking at a chart of its currents, without ever standing in the water.

Humans and AI both try to widen the flashlight beam, but they do it in different ways. For us it means expanding awareness itself, noticing more of what is already here. Meditation showed me that directly. The first time I sat down I realized how noisy my mind was and how little of the present I was actually catching, and it felt like tuning into a channel that had been playing all along but I had never noticed. For AI it means expanding the scope of what it can process, adding new streams of data beyond text. One is about awareness, the other about data, but both are attempts to reach further than their original design allowed.

But sadly, neither "can easily" escape its natural limits. Humans are limited to biology and AI is limited to data and code, but maybe the point is not to escape at all, only to keep widening the light a little further.

<div class="image-wrapper" style="margin: 12px auto;"><img src="/img/sun-rise.jpg"></div>

## What is Your Life's Work?

I'm currently reading [A Ray of Light in The Himalayas](https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Light-Himalayas-Building-Everest/dp/B09Y4VZRBH) about Takashi Miyahara, who dedicated half a century to building a hotel at 3900 meters in the Himalayas with a 360 degree view of mountain ranges including Mount Everest. __That hotel is his life's work.__

Reading about him reminded me of others who could answer this question immediately. Warren Buffett has been building value and a community of investors who trust his philosophy for over 60 years. Arsène Wenger built Arsenal's football for 22 years through wins and severe losses. David Attenborough has been documenting nature for seven decades.

A lot of us work hard but still feel unsure what the work is actually for. Life's work requires finding something you believe in deeply enough to focus on relentlessly, the kind of belief that keeps you going through ups and downs even when things aren't working.

The people who have it get so engaged in what they're building that everything else becomes secondary, not because they're forcing sacrifice but because they believe in it enough that other things don't matter as much. When that belief lasts, it becomes life's work.

_What's yours going to be? What will people remember you for?_

## World Class Network

If you can take out your phone and reach out to three people performing at the highest level, especially people you've actually worked with or know well enough that they'd respond, then you have a _world class network._

People building businesses at global scale, working on cutting edge science or tech, competing at world championships, creating art or music that reaches global audiences. 

If you can't think of any, then that's something to think about.

_This is an ongoing series by [Prashish](https://x.com/prashishh), [Alok](https://alokkhatri.com), & [AI](https://ai-2027.com/)._

_The world is rapidly changing in this age of AI, and this is our exploration, adaptation, with an intention to share it with the broader community, on how existing systems can quickly adapt and integrate LLMs. This work is the result of weeks of working closely with AI as a super assistant._

_This series will be helpful for developers looking to integrate AI into existing applications, technical leaders evaluating LLM adoption strategies, and organizations seeking practical approaches to AI transformation without rebuilding their entire tech stack._

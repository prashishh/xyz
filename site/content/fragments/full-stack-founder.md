## The Full Stack Founder

A full stack founder is someone who has enough skills across many parts of a company, from product and engineering to team and capital. It is not about mastery in every area, but about knowing enough to follow what is going on and to join the work when needed. 

Just like a full stack engineer works across the entire technical stack, a full stack founder works across the entire company stack.

It starts with **I am an engineer**, then **I can build a product**, then **I can bring people together and lead a team**, then **I can bring in revenue**, then **I can raise money**, and finally **I can carry the whole idea forward**.

 The skills span *engineering and design, team building and culture, storytelling and strategy, revenue and finance, funding and investor relations.*

This progression used to happen slowly as companies grew and hired. Now, with AI tools and small teams, founders move through these skills faster and hold multiple roles longer. Range is no longer optional.

A full stack founder knows enough in each area to sit with any part of the team, understand their work, ask good questions and make clear decisions for now, and then hand it over when someone better arrives.

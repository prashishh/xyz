## Infinite Software

You can generate a working app from a single prompt today, something that was **unthinkable** a decade back. AI can now write, debug, execute code and deploy it to the cloud, in a single coding session. 

What used to require devs, time and money now takes a prompt. This naturally pushes the marginal cost of creating one more piece of software toward **zero**.

It's like what happened with photography when cameras went from analog to digital and ended up in phones. You had 24 or 36 shots on a roll of film, so you thought before you clicked. But once the marginal cost of taking one more photo became zero, people started taking thousands without thinking.

Similarly, opening a physical store costs real money for inventory, rent and other physical expenses, whereas opening a digital shop on Instagram doesn't really cost anything. The same is happening with software.

Software code, at its core, is compute. More AI models launch every few months, competition pushes prices down, data centers scale up around the world and chips get better. As compute gets cheaper, generating code gets cheaper. The marginal cost of creating software approaches zero.

We'll have infinite software, but not infinite good software.

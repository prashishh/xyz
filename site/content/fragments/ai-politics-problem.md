I've been seeing these polished documents floating around social media with detailed solutions and examples for [Nepal's political crisis](https://nepalitimes.com/news/kathmandu-burns-despite-pm-resignation), mostly written by ChatGPT or other AI systems. __This is quite insane and borderline dangerous. I can't stress this enough!__

Nepal just went through massive upheaval, where people died in the streets because of decades of political dysfunction. And some people think feeding prompts to generate the perfect solution to the problem is going to solve the issue.

ChatGPT and other AI systems are nothing but __sophisticated autocompletes__, and they don't understand Nepal's internal politics, ethnic tensions, economic dependence on remittances and its big neighbors, or why the same political class has been playing musical chairs for decades. My biggest fear is that young leaders might actually take its suggestions seriously. The last thing you need is fake wisdom generated by a machine that has zero understanding of what's on the ground.

A nation is not a coding problem, and you can't debug centuries of political mess with prompts and algorithms. Talk to experts, and stop outsourcing your political thinking to machines. Real solutions require humans who actually live with the consequences. This moment is immensely important.

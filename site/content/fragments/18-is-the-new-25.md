## 18 is the New 25

AI can teach you technical skills like programming, data analysis, digital marketing, and design tools faster than university can, especially for things that change every few months. What it can't teach you is how to work with a team, handle real deadlines, or deal with customers, and that only comes from being in the field i.e. experience.

The old model was spend four years at university till you're 25, then start working. But for most fields, especially in tech, you can start at 18 with an apprenticeship, an internship, or an entry level job. The new model is to learn by doing and pick up what you need from AI along the way. Do your degree on the side if you need it, or finish it in two years instead of four.

Two years working puts you ahead of two years sitting in lecture halls. These days employers care more about what you've built and what you can do than what degree you have. It is important to start earlier, get more time on the field, learn faster and iterate.

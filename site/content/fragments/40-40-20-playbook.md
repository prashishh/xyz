Most developers spend 100% of their time just coding and wonder why they're not growing. The game changed when AI got good enough to write code with you. If you're not adjusting your time allocation, you're already behind.

**40% - actual deep work:** writing code, designing architectures learning new paradigms, reviewing other people's code, the stuff that still needs real human developer as of 2025.

**40% - using AI tools:** to optimize everything, learning Cursor, Claude Code and new coding assistant tools coming out, MCP and all the experimental AI, bringing collective coding intelligence into your workflow, making yourself faster.

**20% - the human element:** sharing your work through blogs or tweets, contributing to open-source, showing up at meetups and conferences, talking to people and surprisingly the best devs will also scale this up in the next decade.

If you're spending 100% on just coding, you're optimizing for a world that ended two years ago.
